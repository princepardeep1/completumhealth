Hi There, 

# I am using Latest React native version for this assignment . You must have Updated version of React too for run this project i.e 18
#   Your app should support both portrait and landscape orientations on both phones and tablets.
# On phones, the list and detail should be separate screens, on tablets, the list and detail should both appear on the same screen.
#  On all devices, the list view should be displayed as a text only, vertically scrollable list of character names.
# The app should offer search functionality that allows users to filters the character list to entries whose titles or descriptions contain the query text
# Clicking on an item should load the detail view of that character, including the characterâ€™s image, title, and description. You choose the layout of the detail.
# For the image in the detail view, use the URL path in the "Icon" field of the API JSON response. For items with blank or missing image URLs, use a placeholder image of your choice. The path must be appended to https:// duckduckgo.com/ in order to be resolved.
# Two variants of the app should be created, using a single shared codebase. Each variant should have a different name, package-name, and url that it pulls data from. (We're interested in your methodology for creating multiple apps from a shared codebase)

Above mentioned points are added. Please feel free to ask me if something is not working 

Thanks & Regards
